# Duplicate Student Checking Feature

## Overview
When uploading new student data (via file upload or Google Drive), the system now automatically checks for duplicate students and handles them intelligently.

## How Duplicate Detection Works

### Detection Criteria
A student is considered a duplicate if **both** of the following match an existing student:
- **Name** (case-insensitive, trimmed)
- **Grade/Year** (case-insensitive, trimmed)

### What Gets Updated for Duplicates
When a duplicate is found, the system **only updates**:
- âœ… **Total Fees** - Updated to new value
- âœ… **Net Amount** - Recalculated based on new total fees
- âœ… **Number of Subjects** - Updated to new value
- âœ… **Remaining Balance** - Recalculated (new net amount - existing payments)
- âœ… **Status** - Updated if balance becomes zero

### What Gets Preserved for Duplicates
The system **preserves existing data** for:
- ðŸ”’ **Student ID** - Keeps original ID
- ðŸ”’ **Phone Number** - Keeps existing phone
- ðŸ”’ **Enrollment Date** - Keeps original enrollment date
- ðŸ”’ **Total Paid** - Preserves all existing payments
- ðŸ”’ **Discount Percent** - Keeps existing discount
- ðŸ”’ **Discount Amount** - Keeps existing discount amount

## User Experience

### File Upload Response
When uploading a student file, users will see:
```
Processing complete!
â€¢ 15 new students added
â€¢ 3 duplicates found and updated
  (Updated fees and subject count only)
```

### Google Drive Import Response
When processing from Google Drive:
```
2 file(s) processed successfully.
â€¢ 25 new students added
â€¢ 5 duplicates updated (fees & subjects only)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
1. **Modified `saveStudentsToSheets()` in `studentService.js`**:
   - Checks existing Master_Students sheet for duplicates
   - Separates students into "new" and "update" lists
   - Updates duplicate rows in-place using Google Sheets API
   - Adds only new students to the sheet

2. **Added `updateRowRange()` method in `googleSheets.js`**:
   - Supports updating specific cell ranges in Google Sheets
   - Used for updating existing student rows

3. **Enhanced return values**:
   - APIs now return detailed statistics about processing
   - Includes counts of new students, updates, and duplicates found

### Frontend Changes
1. **New Upload Component** (`upload-students-btn.tsx`):
   - File input for Excel/CSV files
   - Shows detailed processing results
   - Handles duplicate information in success messages

2. **Enhanced Drive Processing** (`process-drive-students-btn.tsx`):
   - Updated to show duplicate information
   - Better user feedback about what was processed

3. **Added to Header**:
   - Upload button now available in header alongside Drive import
   - Both show duplicate handling results

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Student
```
Upload: Ahmed Mohamed, Grade 10, 3 subjects, 3000 EGP
Result: Added as new student with generated ID
```

### Scenario 2: Duplicate Student - Fee Update
```
Existing: Ahmed Mohamed, Grade 10, 2 subjects, 2500 EGP, 1000 EGP paid
Upload:   Ahmed Mohamed, Grade 10, 4 subjects, 3500 EGP
Result:   Updated to 4 subjects, 3500 EGP total, 2500 EGP remaining (kept 1000 EGP paid)
```

### Scenario 3: Duplicate Student - Same Name, Different Grade
```
Existing: Ahmed Mohamed, Grade 10
Upload:   Ahmed Mohamed, Grade 11
Result:   Added as new student (different grade = not duplicate)
```
